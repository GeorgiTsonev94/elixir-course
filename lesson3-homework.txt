Exercises

Create a function “length_of_tuple”, that returns the number of elements in a tuple.
If they are more than 4, return the string “Shouldn’t you use list?”

length_of_tuple = fn
{} -> 0
{a} -> 1
{a,b} -> 2
{a,b,c} -> 3
{a,b,c,d} -> 4
_-> "Shouldn't you use list"

Homework

Write a function that takes three arguments. If the first two are zero, return “FizzBuzz.”
If the first is zero, return “Fizz.” If the second is zero, return “Buzz.” Otherwise return the third argument.

Examples
     Arguments   Result
     0, 0, 5 “FizzBuzz”
     0, 1, 2 “Fizz”
     1, 0, 2 “Buzz”
     1, 1, “Test”

func = fn
0,0,a -> "FizzBuzz"
0,a,b -> "Fizz"
a,0,b -> "Buzz"
a,b,c -> c
end


Write a function that checks if list is empty. It should return “true” if it is, and “false” otherwise

func = fn
[] -> "true"
_-> "false"


You have a map with the following structure:

 %{first_name: "Alice", second_name: "Hemingway", age: 20}


Write a function, that when receives that map, returns the string “Hello, Alice Hemingway!”

func = fn
person = %{first_name: fname, second_name: sname, age: a}-> "Hello, " <> person.first_name <> " " <> person.second_name <> "!"
end 

Put the functions in a text file, and push it to your repo
